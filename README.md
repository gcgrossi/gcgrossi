### About me

Hallo I am an 
- üçï italian
- ü™ê nerd
- ‚öõÔ∏è physicist
- üíç The Lord of The Rings scholar
- ü¶à sharks lover

I think this tells a lot about me. My career path starts during my Master Thesis. My supervisor gave me a Linux terminal and told me:
> This is a Linux terminal. Play a little bit with it! üò±

I studied Particle Physics at the University but I learnt Data Science on the battle field üí£. I was analysing Pbs of data  in C++ at the CERN's LHC proton accelerator when Stack Overflow was just at the beginning. I learned the hard way, cracking my head against the wall.

I decided to study Finance at some point üí∏, and got another Master degree + a CFA Level1. 

I love studying you can tell! üìñ

I now do Asset Management and Quantitative Finance but I also engage in different Data Science projects. I like playing with data and technology so I just take on the challenges I like the most and try to use the entire Tech stack to have good times. I engage in every kind of data related activity that I find interesting.

And when it's not just a matter of fun, I love creating business value. With my MBA studies I also have a good in depht knowledge of Business Administration! üï¥Ô∏è
